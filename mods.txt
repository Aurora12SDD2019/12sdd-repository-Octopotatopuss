This is where you will write the psuedocode
corresponding to the python code in mods.py

BEGIN LoadArray
  #The purose of this module is to load data to an array 
  Let i = 1
  Read DataValue

  #if the user enters "xxx" it means they have finished entering data
  WHILE DataValue < > “xxx” #the "< >" symbol means not equal to 
    Let thisArray[i] = DataValue
    i = i + 1
    Read DataValue
  ENDWHILE

  Let NumElements = i
  Display“ There are” NumElements “ items loaded into the array”
END LoadArray
